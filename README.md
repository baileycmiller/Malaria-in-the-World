# Malaria-in-the-World

This is a data visualization made with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and d3. It was made for my IMS 261 class senior year at Miami University.

Mosquitoes are the most deadly animals in the world, killing more people than even humans per year. One of the most dangerous mosquito-borne diseases is malaria, which is caused by parasites that are transferred by the insect. The disease has become a widespread crisis, especially in Africa. In this data visualization, I wanted to show where on Earth malaria exists and how its prevalence has changed in the past decade and a half. I also wanted to make connections with climate data to draw conclusions about the environmental influences on the disease.

This visualization works best on large screens with Firefox, Safari, or Chrome.
